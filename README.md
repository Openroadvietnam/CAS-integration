### [CAS](https://github.com/Jasig/cas/) is the standard mechanism by which web applications should authenticate users.

CAS provides enterprise single sign-on service:

* An open and well-documented protocol
* An open-source Java server component
* A library of clients for Java, .Net, PHP, Perl, Apache, uPortal, and others
* Integrates with uPortal, BlueSocket, TikiWiki, Mule, Liferay, Moodle and others
* Community documentation and implementation support
* An extensive community of adopters


## Why do we need to intergrate CAS into Openroad?

Openroad have many intergrated software. We need to SSO gurantee for user that  one account use for every software.

Openroad use  [CAS server](https://github.com/Jasig/cas) and [CAS client](https://wiki.jasig.org/display/CASC/Home) to do that.
